          The Story Behind AcroKit
        </h2>

        <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Hi, I&apos;m the creator of AcroKit. Like many acroyoga
            practitioners, I spent years frustrated with flow builders that let
            you create impossible sequences. You&apos;d spend time crafting what
            looked like a beautiful flow, only to discover during practice that
            half the transitions were physically impossible or awkward.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The breaking point came during a workshop where I spent 30 minutes
            building a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; flow for my students, only to
            realize mid-session that there was no logical way to get from Bird
            Pose to Standing Hand-to-Hand without an uncomfortable dismount and
            reset. My students were confused, I was embarrassed, and the flow
            was ruined.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            That night, I had a simple idea: what if the tool only showed you
            poses you could actually transition to? What if building flows was
            constrained by real biomechanics and physics, not just wishful
            thinking?
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            AcroKit was born from that frustration and that insight. Every
            transition has been carefully curated to ensure it actually works in
            practice. Every pose suggestion is filtered by what&apos;s
            physically possible from your current position. The result? Flows
            that work the first time, every time.
